Python script for Dividend Aristocrat data

# Description
This is a basic Python script that does the following:

1. Scan list of stock ticker symbols from a text file (Currently these are the Dividend Aristocrats: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Dividend_Aristocrats)
1. Grab their "Ex Dividend Date" from the IEX Cloud API (My Referral link: https://iexcloud.io/s/63148f59)
1. Write data to a file.
1. Use this data however you want. I usually import it into Google Sheets for more sorting, etc.
1. That's it!

# Why?
This is a starting point for much grander plans. I currently use M1 Finance (Another referral link: https://m1.finance/uPCPS1kLoUUx) with fractional shares to invest in Dividend Aristocrats.
This is a way to grab specific data about these stocks and organize them in a way I see fit for my own research.

Of course, there is A LOT more data that is available, but this is just a starting point.

Feel free to contribute or ask questions.
